if you have trouble running this from local, try this out it might works. dont forget to install the dependencies 

Hi,
I was trying to get my website locally (in VC code) and after more than an hour I've succeeded :)
I've written following readme, maybe it will help :

`to run this website localy:
0) instal ruby on rails and jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/

change the GemFile as follow:
comment the line:
#gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
uncomment following lines:
gem "jekyll"
gem "jekyll-paginate"
gem "jekyll-gist"
gem "jekyll-redirect-from"
gem "kramdown-parser-gfm"
gem "webrick"

bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve

open http://127.0.0.1:4000/ in your browser`
